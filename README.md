1.0      Introduction
The Hotel Ordering system is a system that helps ICT users offer a systematic and well planned form of support to other users in the organization. It is used in an Organization with two levels of support namely; Manager (service desk Support) and Second line support (waiter and customers). A brief introduction of how this system is implemented is, the customer orders the Food they want, then the Manager will assign the duty to a waiter and the waiter will log into the Hotel ordering app and from there will be able to see the task. When the Waiter is done serving then he will print the receipt and it will also be indicated in the APP. The manager will be able to see the same too.

1.1Background Study
For a long time, organizations have had a system of user support in their ICT department. Most of these organizations implemented a one on one reporting system, where if one encounters an ICT related problem, he or she walks to the ICT department and reports his case then proper assistance is given to this user. Others implemented the use of IP phones and networked telephones to call the ICT department which will necessitate one to come and personally view what problem the user is encountering. However, with recent years, better tools have been emerging to facilitate user support. Some have implemented the use of company mails or group mails to facilitate this. Others have developed customized tools for this particular endeavour. One major challenge in Business management in Kenya is ineffective utilization of resources and lack of proper record keeping leading to wastages and outright fraud by the staff. This is particularly true in the hospitality industry. The Hotel management information system is a system that aids the management of the Customers’ data, Hotel staff data, customers’ registration, Customer accommodation or allocation into specific rooms, room reservation and Personnel staff management.



                                
 1.2 Problem Statement
Generally, aligning ICT with an organization is done with the hope of making the organization’s operations more efficient and effective among other benefits like reducing costs. However, if aligning and integrating ICT with the business will not achieve this goal, then most companies would be straining if they would insist in keeping their activities ICT integrated. This would require that ICT processes be effective and efficient themselves. User support to be precise is a section of ICT that has for far long being inefficient in organizations. Having a way of efficiently recording what work has been done and to what extent it has been done, has proven to be a cumbersome and almost impossible task. Most of the time users spend many days idling and waiting for an ICT officer to attend to them, whereas the officer is not even a where he has such a task to perform. Having a way to solve this problem by recording what tasks are to be done, which ones have been done and who is specifically going to do them, will go a long way in improving the efficiency of the support sector of most organizations.
1.3 General aims of the study
  Is to develop a Hotel Information Management System

1.3.1 Specific objectives 
The aim of the proposed system is to provide solutions to the problems stated above and help the user to manage the hotel effectively and efficiently through:
i )Adequate Record Keeping: To eliminate manual record keeping and install an electronic record keeping thereby ensuring adequate record of transactions are kept. This ensures a centralized system where all necessary data and information can easily be accessed, Tracked, and monitored
ii)Reduced Incidence of Fraud: The program is envisaged to reduce the incidence of fraud both by staff and outsiders through proper record keeping, tracking and monitoring of transaction operations in the organization.
iii) Maximum Accountability: To Instil accountability in the process of management in the hotel organization by not only reducing incidence of fraud, but also eliminate wastages.
iv)  Provide Data Security: The study will install security measures by providing different access levels to various staff.


1.4 Significance
Implementing this tool in organizations will bring with it various advantages. These include: Increase accountability as it is well known who is to undertake what particular duty. Increase level of efficiency in communication e.g. transfer of messages that define tasks from user to officers in charge. Provide a definite way of keeping track of whatever tasks are undertaken by the officers. Minimize laziness in the workforce by making unperformed duties visible. The Hotel Management system is developed to overcome the most of the problems occurring in the manual system by computerizing the existing system. The features of the newly proposed computerized system are described in brief; after computerizing the system, the Hotel Administrator can finish their work in the least amount of time possible and with very little effort. The computerized system has many gains and efforts which the manual system cannot give in any type of situation. In any manual system if we take the main problem arising is to maintain the number of records and finding a particular record, computerized systems are most helpful in dealing with areas where database comes into existence. A computer can hold large amount of data in storage devices and it can operate at a very high speed. The user can input all types of information into the computer and can be able to perform any type of task which when done manually is tedious and time consuming.   

1.5 Limitation:
The tool like any other has limitations, although it by far covers loop-holes created by earlier systems. These include:
1.	Tasks can only be communicated to the officers via this system and not through other means.
2.	The tool does not provide a deadline for the tasks to be completed.
3.	A well-defined summary of job performed is not provided.

                     LITERATURE REVIEW
2.0 Introduction
Often Hotel ordering app is implemented in many organizations by just making a call to the ICT department and reporting what sort of error you have. One then has to hopefully wait to be served by the department but one is not assured completely that someone is taking care of his problem. In the recent years, steps have been made to make the user feel more assured that the duties he or she presented are being looked into and will be resolved soon. Different views are held by many organizations about ICT support in general. This is because Information and communication technology (ICT) has contributed immensely to social and economic improvements, such as higher employment and productivity, increasing access to a higher quality of life. ICT incorporates electronic technologies and techniques used to manage information and knowledge, including information-handling tools used to produce, store, and process, distribute and exchange information.
Republic of South Africa (RSA). 1995. Labor Relations Act (No. 66 of 1995). Government Printers: Pretoria.  “Benefits of ICT can be achieved directly, through improved healthcare provision and disease prevention, or indirectly, through improved social infrastructure, economic growth, or other broader determinants of population health”. In the context of organizational benefits, countless merits can be recorded day after day.
2.1User support activities
In reference to an article by Gregory K. H (2017) University of London Computer Sector. Routledge- London, “The costs of implementing and managing an in-house IT Service Desk can be a significant investment.  In addition, resources or technical expertise for projects are not always available in house and Institutions are therefore considering the use of third party organizations to provide their IT support either full time or on demand.” In doing so, Institutions are able to deliver the ICT projects they require on time and budget and can often take advantage of this more cost effective model because of the economies of scale.  There are also the obvious benefits of guaranteed service levels and extended hours of support.
2.1.1 ICT Strategy Consultancy and Review: Many organizations produce an ICT strategy but they may not consider alternative ways of delivering ICT services to its users.  Using an external organization to perform an independent audit could be a way of saving thousands of pounds. However if a department can perform this inwardly it also works fine.

2.1.2 Virus/patch management: With the plethora of virus' released on a daily basis, countless organizations suffer from unremitting virus outbreaks or worm attacks, many of which can bring an organizations infrastructure down in seconds. With the consequence of poor virus management being so great, it is believed that investment in virus protection is crucial. It is vital, therefore, to specialize in both virus protection and removal and ensure that all our managed desktops are equipped with the latest windows/virus definition updates to minimize the impact of any future attack.

2.1.3 Hardware Maintenance: In order to minimize downtime in the event of a PC's hardware failing, acquire a very-high level maintenance service with a hardware seller to make sure that a PC is back up and running in the least time possible. If a hard drive needs replacing, then have ghost images to get the PC rebuilt and back on the desk in no time.

2.1.4 Desktop Build Imaging: As mentioned above under hardware maintenance, desktop imaging is a sure way of minimizing down time in the event of a PC crash. It is important to create a build library which contains images for individual institutes/organizations that are created specifically for their needs. In the event that a machine needs to be rebuilt this can be done rapidly using one of the many images in the library.

2.1.5 PC Refreshing: One of the principal causes of hardware and software failure is the age of a PC. Aging hardware can also affect performance and in certain circumstances prove to be a security risk if not upgraded. It is advised that all hardware should be refreshed every 3-4 years and are constantly participating in roll out projects to keep ahead of these issues.

2.1.6 Print Management: The printer is an essential tool that has become an integral part of everyday business. In many organizations, the ability to print out a document is taken for granted until such time as a critical document needs to be produced for meetings. Support will ensure that the printing solution is built around an efficient central print server which in turn ensures a more reliable and supportable system.

2.1.7 Security Control/Management: In today's world, security has got to be at the top of an organization’s IT strategy. Therefore, support is constantly looking at ways of securing our environment and some of these include: password policies; user account management; regular audits of file permissions and documentation amongst others. Another security hole on the Desktop side is user rights to a PC - administrative rights to desktops in the wrong hands can cause major disruption to organizations.

2.1.8 Application Support: Desktop Support currently supports a whole host of applications from standard MS Office applications to specialized applications like Quark or File maker Pro. Every new piece of software that is introduced into an environment is fully tested to check for conflicts with OS's or other applications prior to release. If an application is not on our list of supported applications we will support this to the best of our knowledge.

2.1.9 Software Distribution/Upgrades/Installation: when an application needs to be deployed to a large organization it can prove to be very time consuming. User support aims to do this from a central location and push applications out to an organization. It uses monitoring tools to ensure that all desktop machines are up-to-date with the latest virus definition files and the latest windows updates to ensure no holes in the security of the machines. All new software, as mentioned before, is tested before being allowed to be installed in a live environment.

                   SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
3.0 SYSTEM ANALYSIS
System analysis involves investigating a system, identifying problems and using the information to recommend improvements to the system. It helps one understand if the proposed system is worth undertaking and hence would bring benefits. The following were carried out during the development this system:

3.0.1   Feasibility Study
This represents an opportunity to firm up knowledge of the system and to form ideas about the scope and costs of possible alternatives solutions before change on the basis of four feasibility criteria.

3.0.2 Technical Feasibility
This feasibility looks at what is practical and reasonable it addresses the following major issues:
1) Is the proposed Technology or Solution Practical?
2) Do the currently necessary Technology possessed locally?
The defined solution and expertise required was not available. I preferred to use proven technology thus developing the system using the following:-
1. NetBeans compiler
2. XAMPP server
3. MySQL database.

3.0.3 Operational Feasibility
This relates to the ability of the people working within a system to do their job in a prescribed manner. An operational feasibility criterion measures the urgency of the problem or the acceptability of a solution and analysing the effectiveness of the solution.
The study answers the following question:
1) Is the Problem worth Solving, or Will the Solution Work?
2) How does end – users feel about their role in the new system?
The proposed solution will relieve the receptionist from work of searching for files on shelves. It will also relieve the management from the cost of buying files.
3.0.4 Operational Feasibility
The study answers the following question:
1) Given the technical expertise, is the project deadline reasonable?
2) Can the solution be designed and implemented within an acceptable time period?
According to the work schedule of completing this project, there will be enough time to design, test and evaluate the system successfully.
3.0.5   Economic Feasibility
The Economic Feasibility Analysis is to judge whether the possible benefits of solving the problem is worthwhile. This is the measure of the cost- effectiveness of a project or solution or cost benefit analysis.

3.1 REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
3.1.1System Analysis Models
Use Case Diagrams
These are flow of events in the system, including interaction with actors. It usually initiated by an actor. Actors represent the various external people or entities that interact with the system.
The use case of the interschool transfer system consists of only a single user, the administrator.
The activities carried by the staff include;
1.	Log in
2.	Choose your section
3.	View any requests
4.	View departmental reports and print them
5.	View general reports on the system


Customer use case:

 








3.2 Database Design
I used a relational database design (RDBS).In RDBMS, it’s possible to organize large amount of data and provides relationship between the datasets in and Understandable manner. RDBMS provides flexible structures which can accommodate every kind of data. Relationships are created by use of keys. RDBMS also offered flexibility that enabled redesign and regeneration of report from database without need of re-entering the data. SQL is a language used to create, manipulate, examine and manage relational database. SQL was standardized in 1992 so that a program could communicate with database system without having to change SQL commands .One is required to send commands after creating a connection.

3.3 Methodology
A methodology is a formalized approach to implementing the Software Development Life Cycle SDLC (i.e., it is a list of steps and deliverables). There are many different systems development methodologies, and they vary in terms of the progression that is followed through the phases of the SDLC. Some methodologies are formal standards used by government agencies, while others have been developed by consulting ﬁrms to sell to clients. For the ICT User Support tool I chose the Waterfall Methodology. I chose this methodology to develop this system because the phases do not overlap since one phase is completed before the next phase can begin. The methodology worked well with my project since requirements were well understood.

3.4 Steps of Waterfall Methodology
The following stages are followed in waterfall methodology:
1) Analysis
2) Design
3) Implementation
4) Testing
5) Maintenance
Analysis
After requirements had been gathered they were analyzed for their validity and possibilities of being incorporated into the development of the system.
Design
System design was prepared from the requirement specification document which was studied in the analysis phase. Overall system architecture was defined in this phase.
Implementation
Actual coding began in this phase after dividing the system into modules.
Testing
After coding, the codes are tested against the requirements to make sure the product is actually solving the needs gathered during analysis phase. Unit testing, integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing were done at this phase.
Maintenance
Includes all the processes after deploying the system.
1.7	Benefits of the waterfall methodology
1) The model is simple and easy to understand and use.
2) Easy to manage due to rigidity
 3) The model works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood.
4) It is focused on implementation therefore saving knowledge for tomorrow.

3.6 Methods of data collection
At the requirement gathering stage, I used a number of data collection techniques which included:
1) Interviews
2) Questionnaires
3) Observing
4) Studying of manual documents available about the ICT user support system currently in place.







4.0 PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques applied to project activities in order to meet the stakeholders’ needs and expectation. Once selected, a systems development project undergoes a thorough process of project management, the process of planning and controlling the project within a speciﬁed time frame, at minimum cost, with the desired outcomes. For the ICT User Support tool, the following is the proposed budget.

4.1 PROJECT BUDGET

6.0 Conclusion
This system is simple and supports any type of user as long you are registered as user of the system. An individual needs to remember his/her employee number and password in order to login. Actions that can be performed by individual users have been earlier mentioned. The system will make efficient the user support function of every food department if successfully integrated and implemented in various organizations. In conclusion we believe this project if properly utilized will save time, reduce the amount of work the administration has to do, and will replace the stationery material with electronic apparatus. The system should also serve as a major tool to improving the efficiency in Hotel management. Hence a system with expected results has been developed but there is still room for improvement
